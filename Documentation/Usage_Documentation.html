                    <p>
                        In the process of creating the multi-armed bandits experiment system, there was some internal terminology
                        developed and used. Where possible, this documentation will strive to either use clearer terminology and/or 
                        to define these terms in the places they are used. However, in case some instances are missed, the terminology
                        definitions are collected here.
                    </p>
                    <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                        <li>
                            <b>joint</b>:
                            The term 'joint' refers to information, files, etc, that are, in some way, tied to both applications and 
                            algorithms.<br> 
                            In the namespace system, the information chosen to identify an individual run (timestamp, random id) is 
                            configurable on the level of which application is paired with which algorithm. Since it pertains to both, 
                            the configuration information is known as joint information or the joint configuration and files and folder 
                            used to hold this information are also referred to as joint.<br>
                            In the system for looking up parameters, any static values that calculated using information from both the 
                            application and the algorithm are known as joint parameters and are stored and accessed using the global 
                            variable joint_index.

                            <b>namespace</b>: 
                            The term 'namespace' refers to how the file paths of experiment result files are configured. Similarly, 
                            'namespace system' refers to the sub-system that calculates these paths and changes the paths and configurations 
                            for existing and current files, and 'namespace files' refers to files specifying the configurations for different
                            applications, algorithms, and application-algorithm pairs.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a format for serializing object data (no functions) as text.
                        All system, logging, and input files used by the system use JSON format, so an overview is provided here.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>Values in JSON are all one of the following datatypes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>

                                    <b>String</b>:
                                    A JSON String functions like a String in most programming languages (sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks) with one notable rule:
                                    The quotation marks surrounding the sequence of characters MUST be double quotes. So "hello" is a valid JSON String and 'hello' is not.
                                </p>

                                    <b>number</b>:
                                    Numbers are represented in JSON the same way they are represented in most programming languages. Numbers can be in integer or floating point format,
                                    hexadecimal and other formats are not supported.

                                    Objects in JSON are containers for variables, similar to Python dictionaries. They consist of a right curly brace ({), a left curly brace (}),
                                    and zero or more comma-separated JSON variables between them.<br>
                                    <b>Example 1:</b><br>
                                    {}<br>
                                    <b>Example 2:</b><br>
                                    {"alive":true}<br>
                                    <b>Example 3:</b><br>
                                    {"dead":false, "greeting":"hello", "fastest_runner":null, "best_time":42.2, "other":{"greeting":"hola", "age":32}, "friends":["frank", "joe"]}

                        JSON variables are defined using a JSON String for the variable name, followed by a colon (:) as the assignment operator, and then finally a value that is one
                        of the JSON data types. This is similar to how dictionary items are defined in Python when using an initializer string.
                        <br>
                        <b>For instance:</b> "greetings":["hello","hola","aloha"]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JSON files are simple text files (.txt) with the extension changed to '.json'. The content of a JSON file
                        is a JSON object that is not assigned to anything.
                        <br>
                        <b>For instance:</b>
                        <br>
                        <pre>{
    "greeting":"hello"
}
                        </pre>
                        Could be the entire content of a JSON file.

                    <p>
                        Parts of the documentation mention the use of an 'application name' or an 'algorithm name'.
                        This name should be a string with specific spelling and capitalization used to refer to the application or 
                        algorithm. For example, the influence maximization application has the application name im.<br>
                        This name wil be used within file names and file paths, so it should not contain the basic separator string or 
                        file path break characters and should only contain characters that are valid to use in file paths.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Basic Separator</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term 'basic separator' or 'basic_separator' refers to a global String variable 'basic_separator' located in 'Code/Utilities/program_vars.py'.
                        When constructing the file paths for experimental result files, parameters that are not separated by path breaks (making folders) are separated by this 
                        String.<br>
                        At the time of writing, the value of this String is '_' (The underscore character).<br>
                        While it is theoretically possible to change the value of  the basic separator, no systems are currently in place to enact this change automatically.
                        If you wish to change this value, you need to perform the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Change the value of basic_separator to the new value.</li>
                            <li>Manually replace the previous value with the new one in all locations of all paths for all existing 
                                generated experiment result files.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure that no application or algorithm names contain the new basic_separator value. If they do you will need to change the 
                                conflicting names and replace the old names in all relevant locations. Including:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Application or Algorithm implementation file names.</li>
                                    <li>Parameter file names.</li>
                                    <li>Namespace file names, if a namespace file exists for the application or algorithm in question.</li>
                                    <li>The first item in the "headers" list within the namespace file, if such a file exists.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ensure that no parameter value used in a path uses the new basic separator value in its string representation.
                                For any that do, you will need to change how the string representation is crafted and change the file path 
                                value of any existing files to match the new representation.
                            </li>

                        Input files specifying applications or algorithms have the option to specify a boolean variable 'unique' for every application and algorithm.
                        What that variable does, if set to true, is to specify that every experiment in which the listed application/algorithm configuration 
                        participates should receive a new, deep copy of the parameter dictionary for the configuration. If false, it will save memory by using the same parameter
                        dictionary instance for all experiments in which the application/algorithm participates. This option is available to help avoid side effects if 
                        using the same dictionary instance could cause problems.<br>
                        In cases where this variable does not appear, a default value is used. The default value is defined by the boolean variable 'default_unique_params' 
                        located in 'Code/Utilities/program_vars.py'. At the time of writing, the default value is false.
                        <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> This variable does <b>NOT</b> affect cases where multiple runs are desirable for each instance of the experiment. 
                        Future work on the system may wish to address this shortcoming, but, as a current workaround, designing Applications and Algorithms to 
                        store some initial state for the parameters that is restored when the 'refresh' function is called should work so long as the global variable 
                        'reset' is always set to true in input files.
