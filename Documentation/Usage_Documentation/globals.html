    <h1>Globals</h1>
    <p>
        Global variables used when running experiments, as well as their default values,
        are defined in Code/parameters/global_parameters.py<br>
        As of the time of writing, the variables currently available are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>num_cores</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><b>type:</b> integer</li>
                <li><b>minimum value:</b> 1</li>
                <li>
                    <b>description:</b>
                    <p>
                        The number of processing cores to be used when running experiments and logging results.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>default:</b>
                    <p>
                        The system will attempt to calculate the number of cpus available to it and use all of them.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>num_runs</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><b>type:</b> integer</li>
                <li><b>minimum value:</b> 1</li>
                <li>
                    <b>description:</b>
                    <p>
                        The number of times each experiment configuration is to be run.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>default:</b>
                    <p>
                        1
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <b>refresh</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>type:</b> boolean</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>description:</b>
                        <p>
                            When a experiment specification is run more than one time in a given execution, 
                            it will use the same application and algorithm instances in every run. This means 
                            that randomized parameters, such as network weights, that are set at the time of 
                            creation will remain the same. Additionally, if the Application or Algorithm stores
                            any internal state while running, that state may still remain between runs when running in 
                            single-threaded mode.<br>
                            <br>
                            This variable is passed to a function 'newRun' on the Applications and Algorithms,
                            which, by default, will cause a user-defined refresh method to be called, where 
                            users can write any code necessary to reset the state and/or re-initialize 
                            randomized variables.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>default:</b>
                        <p>
                            True
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </li>
    </ul>
