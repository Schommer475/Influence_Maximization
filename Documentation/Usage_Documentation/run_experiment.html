        <h1>run_experiment.py</h1>
        <p>
            run_experiment.py is a Python file used to run experiments that are specified using an <a href="input_files.html">input file</a>.
            Note that this file expects to be run with the Code directory as the current working directory.
        </p>
        <div>
            This function expects one argument, which must appear first, and an option which may optionally appear after the argument.
            <h2>Argument and Option</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>input file</b>
                    <p>
                        This is the path, relative to the current working directory, to the <a href="input_files.html">input file</a> that should be used 
                        to specify experiments to run.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>-s &ltseed&gt</b>:
                    <p>
                        This option allows the user to specify a random seed that should be set before starting any part of the process to load and run the experiments.
                        This is used to allow experiments to be reproducable and resumable by using a log of which experiments have and haven't
                        completed. If this option is not provided, the system will randomly choose a seed.<br>
                        The seed the system is using will always be outputted to the user before beginning.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Important note:</b> The log files, located in Files/Temporary/Logs, are only used to be able to resume an interrupted set of experiments where
                        they left off. For memory efficiency and to reduce the chance of randomly choosing a seed that already matches one on a log file, these files should be 
                        deleted every so often when you do not need them anymore.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Output Files</h2>
            <p>
                Each experiment iteration also produces an output file (location determined by the configuration
                of the <a href="terminology.html#namespace">namespace system</a>) with a 
                <a href="terminology.html#base_file_name">base file name</a> of <b>results.pkl</b>. The file
                contains an object with two fields: <b>params</b>, contains a serialization of the experiment's
                ParamSet object and can be passed to ParamSet's <a href="ParamSet.html#fromDict">fromDict</a>
                method, and <b>results</b>, contains whatever data was returned from running the Algorithm's 
                <b>run</b> method.
