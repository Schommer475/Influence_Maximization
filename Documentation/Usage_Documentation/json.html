            <h3>Primer on JSON Files</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a format for serializing object data (no functions) as text.
                All system, logging, and input files used by the system use JSON format, so an overview is provided here.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>Values in JSON are all one of the following datatypes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>String</b>:
                            A JSON String functions like a String in most programming languages (sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks) with one notable rule:
                            The quotation marks surrounding the sequence of characters MUST be double quotes. So "hello" is a valid JSON String and 'hello' is not.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>number</b>:
                            Numbers are represented in JSON the same way they are represented in most programming languages. Numbers can be in integer or floating point format,
                            hexadecimal and other formats are not supported.
                            <br>
                            <b>Some examples:</b>
                            <br>
                            42
                            <br>
                            37.0485
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>boolean</b>:
                            Boolean values in JSON are represented by the lower-case literals:<br>
                            true<br>
                            false<br>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>null</b>: 
                            Null values are represented with the literal 'null'<br>
                            <b>For instance:</b><br>
                            "value":null
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>List</b>:
                            Lists in JSON are similar to Lists in Python: they consist of a left bracket ([), a right bracket (]), and zero or more comma-separated JSON values
                            between them.<br>
                            <b>Example 1:</b><br>
                            []<br>
                            <b>Example 2:</b><br>
                            [true]<br>
                            <b>Example 3:</b><br>
                            [false, "hello", null, 42.2, {"greeting":"hola", "age":32}, [45, 38]]
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Object</b>:
                            Objects in JSON are containers for variables, similar to Python dictionaries. They consist of a right curly brace ({), a left curly brace (}),
                            and zero or more comma-separated JSON variables between them.<br>
                            <b>Example 1:</b><br>
                            {}<br>
                            <b>Example 2:</b><br>
                            {"alive":true}<br>
                            <b>Example 3:</b><br>
                            {"dead":false, "greeting":"hello", "fastest_runner":null, "best_time":42.2, "other":{"greeting":"hola", "age":32}, "friends":["frank", "joe"]}
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
                JSON variables are defined using a JSON String for the variable name, followed by a colon (:) as the assignment operator, and then finally a value that is one
                of the JSON data types. This is similar to how dictionary items are defined in Python when using an initializer string.
                <br>
                <b>For instance:</b> "greetings":["hello","hola","aloha"]
            </p>
            <p>
                JSON files are simple text files (.txt) with the extension changed to '.json'. The content of a JSON file
                is a JSON value that is not assigned to anything.
                <br>
                <b>For instance:</b>
                <br>
                <pre>{
"greeting":"hello"
}
                </pre>
                Could be the entire content of a JSON file.
