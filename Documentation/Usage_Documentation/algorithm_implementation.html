            <h1>Implementing an Algorithm</h1>
            <p>
                Algorithms should, ideally, be implemented alongside the creation of the corrsponding
                parameter file. Implementing an Algorithm involves the following
                steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Create the file</b>: The file should be named <b>&ltname&gt.py</b>, where
                    <b>&ltname&gt</b> is the <a href="terminology.html#/app_alg_name">name</a> of the
                    algorithm.<br>
                    The file can be placed anywhere under
                    the directory <b>Code/algorithm</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Implement the Algorithm class</b>: You should import Algorithm from algorithm.algorithm
                    and create a class that extends it. Your class should implement the following instance methods:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>__init__</b>: The constructor. Accepts a <b>BaseParamSet</b> (essentially the same as
                            <a href="ParamSet.html">ParamSet</a>, but you don't specify what section parameters 
                            should go in/come from) and uses it to initialize the Algorithm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>run</b>: 
                            <h4>Parameters</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <b>app</b>: The Application instance on which to run the experiment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>pset</b>: The <a href="ParamSet.html">ParamSet</a> object for the experiment.
                                    Used to look up and (potentially) store parameter values.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>timestamp</b>: The timestamp associated with the experiment run. To be passed
                                    into the ParamSet's <b>getPath</b> function when saving any additional output
                                    files over the course of the experiment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>randId</b>: The random ID associated with the experiment run. Can be passed
                                    into the ParamSet's <b>getPath</b> function when saving any additional output
                                    files over the course of the experiment.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <h4>Effect</h4>
                            <p>
                                Runs the Algorithm on the given Application using the given parameters.
                                Should return an object containing values that it wants saved to file.<br>
                                <br>
                                At the time of writing, all algorithms output an object with two fields:
                                <b>best_seed_sets</b> and <b>rewards</b>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>refresh</b>: This method should do two things:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    It should re-initialize any variables that were initialized using randomness.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It should reset any internal state that it may keep throughout an experiment
                                    run back to the starting state.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            If neither are relevant, than it can simply be implemented and do nothing.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Write a 'createInstance' function</b>: This function exists to act as a universal way to
                    create an instance of the Algorithm, it accepts a <b>BaseParamSet</b> object and passes it
                    to the class's constructor, returning the class instance.
                </li>
