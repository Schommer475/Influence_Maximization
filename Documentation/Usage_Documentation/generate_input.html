            <p>
                generate_input.py is a Python file used to generate input files where the parameters, applications, and algorithms used in the experiments are to be tested in every
                possible combination. Note that this file expects to be run with the Code directory as the current working directory.
            </p>
            <div>
                This function expects two arguments, which must appear first, in the order that they are listed, and two optional flags that, when used, appear after the 
                arguments in any order.
                <h2>Arguments</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>input file</b>:
                        <p>
                            This is the path, relative to the current working directory, to the <a href="input_generation_files.html">input generation file</a> that should be used 
                            to generate the input file.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>output file name</b>:
                        <p>
                            This is the name (the path is always one of two predetermined options) of the generated input file.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Flags</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>-c</b>:
                        <p>
                            This flag specifies that the generated input file should be placed in the directory of commonly used input files (which is tracked by version control).
                            If this option is not supplied, the generated input file will be placed in the directory of temporary input files, which is not tracked by version control.
                            The file can be moved manually later if necessary.<br>
                            <br>
                            The path for the directory of commonly used input files is specified in Code/Utilities/global_names.py by the variable common_inputs. At the time of writing
                            this is 'Files/Inputs/common'.<br>
                            The path for the directory of temporary input files is specified in Code/Utilities/global_names.py by the variable temp_inputs. At the time of writing
                            this is 'Files/Inputs/temp'.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>-r</b>:
                        <p>
                            This flag specifies that the generated output file should be more human readable at the cost of storage space. When used, the json files will be generated
                            with an indentation level of 6.
                        </p>
