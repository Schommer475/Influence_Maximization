                <li id="app_alg_name">
                    <b>algorithm name/application name</b>: This is the name by which an algorithm or application 
                    is identified throughout the system. It is the name that will appear as the name of the file 
                    that the application/algorithm is defined in, as well as the name that will appear on 
                    <a href="#namespace">namespace</a> files that refer to it and within the file paths of experiment 
                    result files. <br>
                    If you define a class to encompass the behavior of the application or algorithm, this may also 
                    be the name of the class, but it does not have to be. For example, the Influence Maximization 
                    application is implemented using a class named Im, however, the actual application name is im 
                    (names are case-sensitive).
                </li>
                <li id="base_file_name">
                    <b>base file name</b>: This refers to the name that a file would have if you were to strip the 
                    path of all the information (and separators in between) that identifies experimental parameters 
                    and the individual run. If there were a <a href="#path_separator">path separator</a> after the 
                    last parameter, this would be the actual name of the file. Most of the time, this will simply 
                    be 'results.pkl'. However, if the run produced intermediate files that it used in its calculations, 
                    or simply wished to produce additional output files, they would use different base file names 
                    in order to differentiate themselves.
                </li>
                <li id="basic_separator">
                    <b>basic separator</b>: Alternately referred to as basic_separator. This is a string or character 
                    that is used to separate parameters or other elements within the file paths of result files 
                    when the path is not broken into a new directory between the two elements.<br>
                    basic_separator may also refer to the variable named basic_separator, defined in 
                    Code/Utilities/program_vars.py, which is used to provide the value of the basic separator.<br>
                    At the time of writing, this value is the underscore character '_'.<br>
                </li>
                <li id="joint">
                    <b>joint</b>: This term is used as a catch all for features or other items that pertain to both 
                    applications and algorithms.<br> 
                    For instance, within the system that handles parameters, parameters 
                    whose values are calculated using information from both the application and the algorithm and 
                    thus cannot be stored in either, are referred to as 'joint parameters'.<br>
                    As another example, within the <a href="#namespace">namespace</a> system, experiment result files are 
                    identified by the parameters of the experiment that produced them. However, files can also 
                    be identified using a couple of values that are unique to the run, in order to allow storing 
                    result files of multiple runs with the same experimental parameters. How the system is configured 
                    to use these run identifying values within a path is customizable at the level of which application 
                    is paired with which algorithm in the experiment. Since this configuration is determined based on 
                    both the application and the algorithm, it is referred to using the term 'joint'. As are the files 
                    used to specify this configuration, the path sections generated using the configuration, etc.
                </li>
                <li id="namespace">
                    <b>namespace</b>: This term is used to refer to the configuration of the file paths for 
                    result files produced by experiments. The subsystem that computes the paths for new experiment 
                    result files using the configuration and handles changing the paths of existing files 
                    to match a new configuration is referred to as the 'namespace system'. The files that specify 
                    aspects of the configuration are known as 'namespace files'.
                </li>
                <li id="path_separator">
                    <b>path separator</b>: This term refers to the, system dependent, character that is used 
                    within the string representation of file paths to indicate a break between a directory and 
                    its contents. In Unix systems, this character is '/'. When the system talks about changing
                    or defining the structure of the file paths, it frequently does so by talking about how the 
                    string representation of the path would change. So, when it talks about setting whether or not 
                    "a path separator should appear" at a certain point, it is actually talking about whether or 
                    not the path should be broken into directory and contents at that location. <br>
                    When writing examples for documentation and usage information, the character '/' is used 
                    for the path separator, regardless of whether that is what your system would use or not.
