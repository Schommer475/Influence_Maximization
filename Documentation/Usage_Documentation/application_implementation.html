            <h1>Implementing an Application</h1>
            <p>
                Applications should, ideally, be implemented alongside the creation of the corrsponding
                parameter file. Implementing an Application involves the following
                steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Create the file</b>: The file should be named <b>&ltname&gt.py</b>, where
                    <b>&ltname&gt</b> is the <a href="terminology.html#/app_alg_name">name</a> of the
                    application.<br>
                    The file can be placed anywhere under
                    the directory <b>Code/application</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Implement the Application class</b>: You should import Application from application.application
                    and create a class that extends it. Your class should implement the following instance methods:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>__init__</b>: The constructor. Accepts a <b>BaseParamSet</b> (essentially the same as
                            <a href="ParamSet.html">ParamSet</a>, but you don't specify what section parameters 
                            should go in/come from) and uses it to initialize the Application.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>getReward</b>: Receives a list <b>choices</b> of options that the algorithm is
                            choosing to try as well as an (optional, there for backwards compatibility with 
                            influence maximization) set of chances that each option will be spontaneously influenced.
                            The list of choices should expect the options to be identified in the same way in which
                            they are identified within the <b>listOptions</b> function.<br>
                            <br>
                            This function should return the reward received from choosing that set of options.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>getOptionCount</b>: This function returns the number of options available for an
                            Algorithm to choose from.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>listOptions</b>: This function returns a list of options available to an algorithm,
                            with the identifiers that correspond to them within the system.<br>
                            For instance, if I have a set of of 13 options, identified with numbers starting from
                            1, but the option that was identified by 6 has been left out of the available options
                            for some reason, then this method will return: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
                            14].
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>refresh</b>: This method should do two things:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    It should re-initialize any variables that were initialized using randomness.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It should reset any internal state that it may keep throughout an experiment
                                    run back to the starting state.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            If neither are relevant, than it can simply be implemented and do nothing.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Write a 'createInstance' function</b>: This function exists to act as a universal way to
                    create an instance of the Application, it accepts a <b>BaseParamSet</b> object and passes it
                    to the class's constructor, returning the class instance.
                </li>
            </ol>
